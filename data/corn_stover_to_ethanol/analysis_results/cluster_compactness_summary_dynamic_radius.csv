0,Pretreatment Chemicals Source,"This unit operation serves as a source for the Pretreatment Chemicals stream, which includes dilute acids and alkalis. These chemicals are essential for the pretreatment process, as they help to disrupt the lignin structure and partially hydrolyze hemicellulose in the biomass feedstock. This step is crucial for enhancing the accessibility of cellulose for subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis, ultimately improving the efficiency of the overall conversion process to produce ethanol.",107,84,1.2627004981040955
1,Fuel-Grade Ethanol Sink,"This unit operation serves as the final sink for the Fuel-Grade Ethanol stream, which is produced after the dehydration of crude ethanol. It is designed to receive the high-purity ethanol, ensuring that it meets the required specifications for blending with gasoline or for use in various industrial applications. The unit operation guarantees the safe storage and handling of the ethanol, maintaining its quality and preventing contamination.",134,116,7.834498405456543
2,Feedstock Handling,"The corn stover, which is a lignocellulosic biomass, is delivered to the processing facility. It is first subjected to size reduction to increase the surface area for subsequent processing steps. This involves mechanical operations such as chopping, grinding, or milling. The reduced-size feedstock is then conveyed to storage silos, ensuring a steady supply for continuous processing.",193,167,3.9166722297668457
3,Fermentation,The hydrolysate is transferred to fermentation tanks where yeast or other microorganisms are added to convert the fermentable sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This biological process is carried out under anaerobic conditions. The choice of microorganism and fermentation conditions are optimized to maximize ethanol yield and productivity.,191,191,15.888586044311523
4,Corn Stover Feedstock Source,"This unit operation serves as the source for the Corn Stover Feedstock stream, which is raw corn stover delivered to the facility. The feedstock consists of a complex mixture of cellulose (35-40%), hemicellulose (25-30%), lignin (15-20%), ash (5-10%), and moisture (5-10%). It is a lignocellulosic biomass that typically requires pretreatment to break down cellulose and hemicellulose into fermentable sugars for further processing in the ethanol production pathway.",101,98,0.7473960220813751
5,Enzymatic Hydrolysis,"The pretreated biomass is subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis, where cellulase enzymes are added to convert cellulose into fermentable sugars, primarily glucose. This step is critical for maximizing sugar yield, which directly impacts ethanol production efficiency. The reaction is typically carried out in large stirred-tank reactors to ensure thorough mixing and enzyme contact with the substrate.",195,168,13.753283500671387
6,Off-gases Sink,"This unit operation serves as a sink for the off-gases generated during the pretreatment process. It is designed to capture and manage gaseous byproducts, primarily consisting of carbon dioxide and volatile compounds. The off-gases may be directed to a waste treatment facility for further processing or utilized in energy recovery systems, ensuring minimal environmental impact and compliance with emission regulations.",85,83,4.792062759399414
7,Waste Treatment,"The stillage and other waste streams from the process are treated to recover valuable byproducts and minimize environmental impact. This may involve anaerobic digestion to produce biogas, or further processing to recover lignin and other components for use as animal feed or energy production.",124,110,4.887430354952812
8,Distillation,"The fermentation broth is subjected to distillation to separate ethanol from water and other components. This involves heating the mixture to vaporize ethanol, which is then condensed and collected as a concentrated product. Multiple distillation columns may be used to achieve the desired ethanol purity.",210,201,7.598145842552185
9,Treated Waste Sink,"This unit operation serves as the final sink for the treated waste stream, which consists of water, biogas, and residual solids. The treated waste is the output from the Waste Treatment unit operation, ensuring that the environmental impact of the process is minimized. This sink is designed to handle the disposal or further processing of the treated waste, facilitating compliance with environmental regulations and promoting sustainable waste management practices.",150,140,2.2215138971805573
