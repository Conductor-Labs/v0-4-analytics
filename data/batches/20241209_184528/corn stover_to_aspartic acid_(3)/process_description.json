This step is crucial for breaking down the lignocellulosic structure, primarily targeting the disruption of lignin and hemicellulose to expose cellulose fibers. Mechanical size reduction is typically performed using milling equipment to reduce the particle size, enhancing the surface area for subsequent chemical treatment. Chemical pre-treatment often involves the use of dilute acid or alkaline solutions to solubilize hemicellulose and partially remove lignin, making cellulose more accessible to enzymes.",
