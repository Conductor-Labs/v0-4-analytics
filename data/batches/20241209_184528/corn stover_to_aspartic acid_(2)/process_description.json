This is typically achieved through a combination of mechanical, chemical, and thermal processes. The corn stover is first chopped into smaller pieces to increase surface area. It is then subjected to a dilute acid treatment, which helps to solubilize hemicellulose and disrupt the lignin structure. This step is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis.",
