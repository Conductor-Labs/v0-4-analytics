This is typically achieved through a combination of physical, chemical, and/or biological methods. In this process, the corn stover is first mechanically chopped to reduce particle size, which increases the surface area for subsequent chemical treatment. An acid or alkaline solution is then applied to the biomass to disrupt the lignin structure and solubilize hemicellulose. This step is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of the downstream enzymatic hydrolysis.",
