0,Enzymatic Hydrolysis,"In this unit operation, the pretreated biomass undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis to convert cellulose and hemicellulose into fermentable sugars. Enzymes such as cellulases and hemicellulases are used to catalyze the breakdown of polysaccharides into monosaccharides like glucose and xylose. This step is critical for maximizing sugar yield, which directly influences the efficiency of the subsequent fermentation process.",125,112,2.9019205570220947
1,Carbon Dioxide Sink,"This unit operation serves as a sink for the Carbon Dioxide stream, which is a by-product of the fermentation process. The Carbon Dioxide is generated during the aerobic conversion of sugars by Bacillus subtilis. This sink is designed to safely collect and manage the Carbon Dioxide emissions, ensuring that they are either captured for further use or released in an environmentally responsible manner.",24,23,1.109080731868744
2,Product Recovery,"This unit operation focuses on the separation and purification of 3-hydroxybutyric acid from the fermentation broth. Techniques such as centrifugation, filtration, and solvent extraction are employed to isolate 3-HBA from the complex mixture. The goal is to achieve a high-purity intermediate suitable for further chemical conversion into 3-hydroxy butyrolactone.",64,63,1.34099031239748
3,Pretreatment,"The pretreatment unit operation is designed to prepare the corn stover for subsequent processing by breaking down its lignocellulosic structure. This involves a combination of mechanical, chemical, and/or thermal treatments to reduce the lignin content and increase the accessibility of cellulose and hemicellulose. Common methods include steam explosion, acid hydrolysis, or alkaline treatment. The goal is to disrupt the complex matrix of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, making the carbohydrates more accessible for enzymatic hydrolysis.",127,117,6.050626277923584
4,Raw Corn Stover Source,"This unit operation serves as the source for the Raw Corn Stover stream, which is collected post-harvest from maize plants. The stream consists of a mixture of cellulose (35-40%), hemicellulose (25-30%), lignin (15-20%), ash (5-10%), and moisture (5-10%). It is an agricultural residue that may require pretreatment to reduce lignin content and enhance the accessibility of cellulose and hemicellulose for subsequent processing steps in the production of bio-based chemicals.",86,68,9.000288128852844
5,Waste Stream Sink,"This unit operation serves as the sink for the Waste Stream generated during the product recovery and purification processes. It collects the residual biomass, primarily consisting of microbial biomass and residual sugars, that is removed from the system. The Waste Stream Sink is crucial for managing waste disposal and ensuring that the process adheres to environmental regulations by facilitating proper treatment or disposal of the waste materials.",227,203,3.6433231234550476
6,Aeration Stream Source,"This unit operation serves as a source for the Aeration Stream, providing a continuous supply of oxygen necessary to maintain aerobic conditions during the fermentation process. The Aeration Stream is critical for the growth and metabolism of the microbial culture, ensuring optimal production of 3-Hydroxypropionic Acid. The stream is designed to deliver the required oxygen concentration efficiently and consistently to support the fermentation process.",24,19,0.36878008022904396
7,Product Packaging,"In this final unit operation, the purified 3-Hydroxypropionic acid is packaged for storage and transportation. This involves ensuring that the product is contained in suitable materials to maintain its purity and stability during distribution.",27,24,0.602245382964611
8,Fermentation,"The fermentation unit operation involves converting the sugar solution into 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3-HBA) using a microbial culture. Specific strains of bacteria or yeast are employed to ferment the sugars, primarily glucose and xylose, into 3-HBA. This bioconversion process is optimized for yield and productivity, requiring careful control of fermentation conditions such as pH, temperature, and nutrient supply.",124,111,1.6196008175611496
9,Chemical Conversion,"In this unit operation, the purified 3-hydroxybutyric acid undergoes chemical conversion to form 3-hydroxy butyrolactone. This transformation typically involves a catalytic dehydration reaction, where a catalyst facilitates the removal of water from 3-HBA to form the lactone ring structure of 3-hydroxy butyrolactone. The choice of catalyst and reaction conditions are optimized to maximize yield and selectivity.",76,68,1.2190060690045357
